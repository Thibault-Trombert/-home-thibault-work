HOW TO COMPILE DMGBOY IN WINDOWS
--------------------------------
DMGBoy needs two libraries that are not included in the source code. These are
"wxWidgets 3" and "SDL". You have to download them and make they
visible to Visual Studio. The next lines explain how to make it.
The compilation was made with Visual Studio 2010 in Windows XP.

WXWIDGETS 3
-----------
Download the wxWidgets 3 headers and precompiled binaries for Visual Studio 2010
32-bit. You can do it from the next urls:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.0/binaries/wxMSW-3.0.0_vc100_Dev.7z/download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.0/binaries/wxMSW-3.0.0_vc100_ReleaseDLL.7z/download
Unzip the two files into the same directory, for example C:\wx\3.0.0

SDL 1.2
-------
Download the Visual C++ development libraries. Here is the url:
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip
Unzip it for example in C:\SDL-1.2.15

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
--------------------
You have to create 3 environment variables in the "User variables" section with
the next names: WXWIN, GBSNDEMU and GLEW. The GbSndEmu and Glew libraries are
included in the DMGBoy source code. For example:
WXWIN    - C:\wx\3.0.0
GBSNDEMU - C:\DMGBoy\src\Gb_Snd_Emu-0.1.4
GLEW     - C:\DMGBoy\src\GUI\3D\glew-1.10.0

COMPILE DMGBOY
--------------
Open DMGBoy.sln and open the project properties.
Under the "VC++ Directories" select "Include Directories" and add the SDL
include directory. For example:
C:\SDL-1.2.15\include
In "Library Directories" add the SDL library directory. For example: 
C:\SDL-1.2.15\lib\x86
Close the project properties accepting the changes. And now you can compile
DMGBoy.
