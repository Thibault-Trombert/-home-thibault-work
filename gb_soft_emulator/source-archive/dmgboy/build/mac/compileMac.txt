HOW TO COMPILE DMGBOY IN MACOS X
--------------------------------
DMGBoy needs two libraries that are not included in the source code. These are
"wxWidgets 3" and "Portaudio". You have to compile by yourself and make they
visible to XCode. The next lines explain how to make it.
The compilation was made with MacOSX 10.9.2 and XCode 5.1.1.


COMPILE WXWIDGETS 3
-------------------
Download wxWidgets 3 source code (3.0.0 tested):
https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
Uncompress it

Type the following in the Terminal (change the paths to the correct ones):
cd path/to/wxWidgets3/
mkdir build-release
cd build-release/
export ARCHVAL="-arch i386"
export SDK19LOC="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk"
export MACMINVER="10.6"
../configure \
       --disable-shared \
       --with-opengl \
       --with-osx_cocoa \
       --with-macosx-version-min=${MACMINVER} \
       --with-macosx-sdk=${SDK19LOC} \
       --prefix="$(pwd)" \
       CFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}" \
       CXXFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}" \
       CPPFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}" \
       LDFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}" \
       OBJCFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}" \
       OBJCXXFLAGS="${ARCHVAL}"
       
Go to "build-release/lib/wx/include/osx_cocoa-unicode-static-3.0/wx/setup.h" and
set "wxUSE_JOYSTICK" to 1
make


COMPILE PORTAUDIO
-----------------
Download portaudio source code (pa_stable_v19_20140130 tested):
http://www.portaudio.com/download.html
Uncompress it

Type the following in the Terminal (change the paths to the correct ones):
cd path/to/portaudio
export ARCHVAL="-arch i386"
export SDK19LOC="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk"
export MACMINVER="10.6"
SDKVER="${ARCHVAL} -isysroot ${SDK19LOC} -mmacosx-version-min=${MACMINVER}"
CFLAGS="-O2 -g -Wall ${SDKVER}" \
    LDFLAGS=" ${SDKVER}" \
./configure
make
    
   
RENAME CONFIG.XCCONFIG
--------------------------
You have to rename the file Config.xcconfig.bak to Config.xcconfig and change
the path of the variables to the correct ones.
The source code of GBSNDEMU is inside the DMGBoy source code.


COMPILE DMGBOY
--------------
Open DMGBoy.xcodeproj with Xcode and compile.
